The .egg file is a distribution format for Python packages. It’s just an alternative to a source code distribution or Windows exe. 
But note that for pure Python, the .egg file is completely cross-platform.

The .egg file itself is essentially a .zip file. If you change the extension to “zip”, you can see that it will have folders inside the archive.

Also, if you have an .egg file, you can install it as a package using easy_install

Example: To create an .egg file for a directory say mymath which itself may have several python scripts, do the following step:

# setup.py
from setuptools import setup, find_packages
setup(
    name = "mymath",
    version = "0.1",
    packages = find_packages()
    )
Then, from the terminal do:

 $ python setup.py bdist_egg
This will generate lot of outputs, but when it’s completed you’ll see that you have three new folders: build, dist, and mymath.egg-info. 
The only folder that we care about is the dist folder where you'll find your .egg file, mymath-0.1-py3.5.egg with 
your default python (installation) version number(mine here: 3.5)
